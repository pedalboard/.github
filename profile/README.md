# Open Pedalboard Hardware and Software Platform

![Logo](img/pedalboard-logo-large.png)

An open source platform for building pedalboard compoenents.

More and more pedalboards are haveing components that offer MIDI capablities. However, reality shows that they are often incopatible
or require some additional processing. 

There are many commercial products around which offer MIDI foot controller cabablities. However these are often expensive solutions.
Also due to chip shortage smaller suppliers of such (very good) solutions are out of stock.

Given the low techincal complexity of building a MIDI foot controller: an open source hard- and software platform could solve many
of these issues in a pretty simple way. 

But wait. Does it have to stop there? Wouldn't it be great to also add some Audio Processing Unit inside the box? 
That would open endless possiblities for custom Stomp boxes and Pedaboards.

Of course this is not a new Idea, there are some projects and platforms alread around. 

This project is different to most of them because it aims to be:

- completely Free & Open Source (hardware and software) GPL Licensed
- modular (if you only want MIDI, you can just not add the audio processing units)
- builder friendly (can be produced with simple tools avilable nearly everywhere)
- re-use popular hardware modules that can be purchased wordlwide.
- The form factor of the hardware is slighly bigger than most of the other projects allowing for more controllers and more processing power.
- Less than a concrete product, this project offers a platform to build pedals on top.
- The goal ist to build a useful tool for life performance, its not intended to be a playground to fiddle around on stage.
